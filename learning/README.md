# Go Learning Path

This directory contains a structured learning path for mastering Go, organized by skill level and complexity.

## Learning Progression

### 📚 [Fundamentals](./01-fundamentals/)
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge, [Getting Started Guide](../docs/tutorials/getting-started.md)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Practical Examples**: [Beginner Examples](../examples/01-beginner/)

Start here if you're new to Go. Covers:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Functions and control structures
- Go workspace setup (GOROOT/GOPATH)
- Simple applications (hello world, basic math operations)

### 🎯 [Intermediate](./02-intermediate/)
**Prerequisites**: Complete [fundamentals](./01-fundamentals/)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks  
**Practical Examples**: [Intermediate Examples](../examples/02-intermediate/)

Build on Go basics with object-oriented concepts:
- Structs and methods
- Interfaces and composition
- Embedding and inheritance patterns
- Real-world design examples

### 🚀 [Advanced](./03-advanced/)
**Prerequisites**: Complete [intermediate](./02-intermediate/)
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 weeks
**Practical Examples**: [Advanced Examples](../examples/03-advanced/)

Master advanced Go concepts and patterns:
- Concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, select)
- Design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral)
- Dependency injection and clean architecture
- Production-ready coding practices

## How to Use This Learning Path

1. **Start at your level**: Use the prerequisites to determine where to begin
2. **Follow the progression**: Each level builds on the previous one
3. **Practice actively**: Run all examples and modify them to test your understanding
4. **Read the code**: Each directory contains working examples with detailed documentation
